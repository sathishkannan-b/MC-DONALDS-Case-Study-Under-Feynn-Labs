 <h2> :book:Problem Statements</h2>
The problem addressed in the McDonald's case study is the need to comprehend systematic differences in consumer perceptions across various market segments.

<h2> :book:Conclusion</h2>
Upon completing the market segmentation analysis and implementing strategic and tactical marketing activities, the success of the market segmentation strategy must be evaluated continuously. Monitoring potential changes within existing market segments or in the broader marketplace is crucial. For instance, shifts in consumer income or new competitors entering the market could impact the effectiveness of McDonald’s marketing strategies. Vigilance is required to detect changes that might necessitate adjustments in strategic or tactical marketing to align with evolving market circumstances. This ongoing assessment ensures McDonald’s remains responsive to dynamic market conditions.
